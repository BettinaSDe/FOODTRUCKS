# Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree

#### _Foodtruck Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

Specs: This **Foodtruck Reviews** project is #MadeWithUdacity - a training how to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. The static design that lacks accessibility has to be converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I have also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.


1. The local server I was running is: `http://localhost:5050` with python.

The photos are all taken by me and I tried my very best not to photograph any person specifically, since this is not my intention.
