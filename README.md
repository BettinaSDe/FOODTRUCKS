# Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree

#### _Foodtruck Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

Specs: This **Foodtruck Reviews** project is #MadeWithUdacity - a training how to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. The static design that lacks accessibility has to be converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I have also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.


1. The local server I was running is: `http://localhost:5050` with python.
The project webpage is: https://bettinasde.github.io/Foodtrucks/
The photos are all taken by me and I tried my very best not to photograph any person specifically, since this is not my intention. The result of the Udacity starter code with "restaurant reviews" in combination with my Foodtruck photos make the resulting website a product of phantasy, i.e. these foodtrucks do not exist at the indicated places in New York with the reviews provided by Udacity. This is a student project to improve coding skills. 
This project is published under a MIT licence.
